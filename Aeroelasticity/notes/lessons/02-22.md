It's necessary to build matematichal models to assess the aeroelasticity of a problem, to solve a flutter problem we need models such as fem (NASTRAN which is coupled with unsteady aerodynamics procedures). The computational and numerical models of fem developed thanks to aeroelastic problems.

## **Static Aroelasticity of tipical sections**

**The typical model will be a rigid wing mounted on an elastic lumped support.**
The typical model derive from the first wind tunnel experiments. The wing is rigid and connected to a torsional system on the wind tunnel wall, this enabled the wind to rotate around the support with a concentrated deformability in one point which is carachterized in order to no the torsional stiffnes. 

### Wing structure
* **Rigid** with a constant section.
* Span perpendiculat to the wind speed.
* **Deformability concentrate in a torsional spring at the root**.
### Aeerodynamics
* **2D strip theory**
* linear behavior since only low ampltude pithc oscillations are considered.

### Typical section
We need to know the reference point around the wing rotate the **Shear Center**

**Shear Center:** it'a a point of a 2D section where if you apply a transverse shear load it produces zero change of twis of the section. It's a property of the cross-section.\
**Elastic Axis:** it's the locus of shear centers along the span of the wing (may not be a straight line). It's typically between 35-45% of the chord for semi-monocoque structure. 

### **Flexural center**

**Flexural Center or center of twist:** it's the point where the shear load P applied to cantilever where it does not cause torsion of the section ACB(slides01 page 6), but not necessarily elsewhere in the wing. In general, the flexural center depend on the load distribution along the beam. The location of the flexural axis may be important for the assessment of bending-twisting coupling of structures. If a load is applied to the shear center o the last wing section there will be a rotation since the load wil be distributed and will crate a rotation starting from the fixed section to the external one, the **shear center is a local property** so it doesn't consider the whole wing. The **flexural center is a global property** instead. 

### **Aerodynamics Center(AC)**
The aerodynamic center is the point of the section around which the steady aerodynamic moment coefficient is constant with respect to changes of angle of attack. $\frac{\partial Cm_{ac}}{\partial\alpha}=0$
if $\alpha$ is small and far from the stall region.

#### 2D INCOMPRESSIBLE
$C_{L\alpha}^{2D}=a_0 \approx 2\pi$  
#### 3D INCOMPRESSIBLE
$C_{L\alpha}^{3D}=\frac{a_0}{1+\frac{a0}{\pi\lambda}(1+\tau)}$ $\lambda$ is the Aspect Ratio and $\tau$ is the non-elliptic lift distribution coefficient.
#### COMPRESSIBLE FLOW
$C_{L\alpha}^C\approx\frac{a_0}{\sqrt{1-M^2}}$  Prandtl-Glauert Correction

$\alpha$ is the angle of attack referred to the zero-lift line of the airfoil.


## Elastic Twist $\theta$ 
$L=qSC_{L\alpha}(\alpha_0+\theta)$\
$M_{AC} = qScC_{m_{CA}}$\
With this two equations we can compute the equlibirium point $\theta$\
$K_{\alpha}\theta = M_{AC}+Le$ 
$K_{\alpha}\theta = qScC_{m_{CA}}+qSC_{L\alpha}(\alpha_0+\theta)e$\
$(K_{\alpha}-qSC_{L\alpha}e)\theta = qScC_{m_{CA}}+qSC_{L\alpha}\alpha_0e$\
$\theta = \frac{qS(cC_{m_{AC}}+eC_{L\alpha})}{K_{\alpha}-qSC_{L\alpha}e}$\
The higher is q the higher will be $\theta$, the hipotesis is that the aerodynamic center is in front of the shear center.

### Feedback Structure

We can schematize the system as a feedback where the input is the initial moment applied to the rigid structure $M_0$, the system is defined as the structure so $M/K_\alpha$ the closed feedback consist of the aerodynamics $qeSC_{L\alpha}$. \
We can define the **Aerodynamic Stiffness** $qK_\alpha = qeSC_{L\alpha}$\
and the **Effective Stiffness** $\tilde{K} = K_{\alpha}-qK_{A}$.

### Torsional divergence

$\theta = \frac{M_0}{K_\alpha}\left(\frac{1}{1-q\frac{K_A}{K_\alpha}}\right)$\
if $q\frac{K_A}{K_alpha}$ goes to 1 then $\theta \rightarrow \infty$\
When the denominator tend to zero the torsion angle tent to become infinitely large and so airfoil “diverges”.\
$q_D=\frac{K_\alpha}{K_A}$

### Divergence dynamic pressure

$q_D=\frac{K_\alpha}{K_A}=\frac{K_\alpha}{eSC_{L\alpha}}$\
$q_D=\frac{1}{2}\rho U_D^2$\
$U_D = \sqrt{\frac{2K_\alpha}{\rho eSC_{L\alpha}}}$

### Aeroelastic Performance Index
Considering an initial moment $M_0$ applied to the structure the deformation obtained by the elastic system will be $\theta_0=\frac{M_0}{K_\alpha}$\
The deformatio obtained by the Aeroelastic System will be  $\frac{\theta}{\theta_0}=\frac{1}{1-\frac{q}{qD}}$\
The more $q$ is close to $q_D$ the higher will be the incidence of aeroelastic effects.
